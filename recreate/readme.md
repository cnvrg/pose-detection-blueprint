# Recreate
This library is created to validate the input dataset format and split it into train/val/test datasets. The user needs to provide the path to the directory containing the dataset with the images, subdivided into their respective categories
> üìù **Note**: The folder names should be named on the classes themselves as the code later extracts the classes from the sub-directories only 

## Arguments
- `--images` refers to the name of the path of the directory where yoga pose images are stored, divided into their respective folders named after their class ..
```
| - yoga_poses

    | - tree
        | - img2.jpg
        | - img50.jpg
