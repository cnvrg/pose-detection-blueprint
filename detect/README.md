# Detect
This library is created to detect the human and their key pose checkpoints as well as draw the bounding box over it. The user needs to provide the path to the directory containing the train and test datasets.
The module uses Movenet to place the bounding boxes over the images and detect the keypoints. It has two variations, Lightning and Thunder, out of which the latter is used in this module.
More information is given at the end of this documentation.
> üìù **Note**: If the user has skipped the recreate portion, then the user needs to provide the images int he format mentioned in the "Model Artifacts" section of the library "recreate"
